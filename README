gnome2remix is a shell script and set of patches to properly build and run
good old GNOME 2.32 on modern Ubuntu LTS 24.04 and Debian 12.

It is not tested in other GNU/Linux distros currently but should work with
slight modifications of list of dependecies.

Usage:
  # bash setup.sh

Notes:
  Please do not mix GNOME 2 with GNOME >= 3 on the same system.

  Install directory is /usr/local/

  Log file is /usr/local/var/gnome2remix.workdir/log

  setup.sh works so that if error occured, it will continue from failed
  position on rerun.

  To enable compositing:
  gconftool-2 -s '/apps/metacity/general/compositing_manager' --type bool true
