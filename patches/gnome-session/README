Current Upower does not have up_client_get_can_hibernate() and
up_client_get_can_suspend() so can not use dependent functions in gnome-session.

Meanwhile I do not use sleep nor hibernation, so remove it.

Also do not check if system supports reboot or shutdown.
Use dumb system(3) call instead for now.

This should be changed to proper solution later.
